## Reactive Spring Playground

#### The simple translation service which allows to parse website content, extract words and translate from source to target language and then load the result. The service is use Google Translate API for translation.

The service demonstrates:
- How to use multi modules architecture with maven as build tool
- How to use String WebFlux among with functional endpoints
- How to make simple translation pipeline using Reactor-Kafka
- How to use Avro serialization for Kafka events
- How to perform database migration using Flyway
- How to use Reactive database connectivity (R2DBC)

#### Note: The architecture and implementation are not the source of truth, but only my subjective vision. And of course there is still room for improvement
